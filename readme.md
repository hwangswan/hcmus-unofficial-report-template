# (Unofficial) report template for HCMUS

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/hcmus-report-template/zyrhmsxynwqs)

- These templates would work (best) in TexStudio or Overleaf. However, `textlive` does **not** install full LaTeX packages. In order to render some packages (e.g. `algorithm`) offline, you **must** install the `texlive-full` package (which is around 5GB!). Therefore we'd recommend you using Overleaf for the best experience.

## Additional note

To use Vietnamese code listing:

```tex
\vietnameselst
\lstinputlisting[language=Language]{filepath}
```
